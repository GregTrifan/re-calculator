Subject: Project Brief: The Regenerative Ratio Dashboard

Before you begin coding, it is essential to understand the project's conceptual foundation. You are tasked with building a web application that serves as an interactive tool for the "Regenerative Ratio Formula," a framework designed to measure a system's health.

Core Concepts:

The application is based on two primary metrics detailed in a research paper by Daniel Mihai and Sharon Gal-Or:

The Regenerative Ratio (Re): This measures a system's potential to regenerate.

Formula: Re = (L * I * F * E) / (X + Fg + Î©)

Purpose: It compares regenerative capacities (like Interconnection I and Feedback F) against degenerative pressures (like Extractive Pressure X and Fragmentation Fg).

Output: The raw score is log-transformed (Re log) for easier interpretation on charts.

The Realized Regeneration Index (Rx): This measures a system's actual, observable outcomes.

Formula: It's the average of several user-defined performance indicators.

Purpose: It grounds the theoretical potential of Re in real-world results.

Output: The score is scaled (Rx scaled) to be visually comparable with Re log.

Application's Core Functionality:

The end-user application must allow a user to:

Create and manage distinct "Projects" to analyze different systems (e.g., a farm, a company).

Save multiple "Time Point Snapshots" for each project, capturing all the Re and Rx scores at a specific moment.

Visualize the evolution of Re log and Rx scaled over time on a line chart.

Store all data in the browser's localStorage, ensuring the app works without a backend or user accounts.

Your first task is to absorb this context. In the next step, you will be instructed on how to take the existing prototype and rebuild it in a professional development environment.
