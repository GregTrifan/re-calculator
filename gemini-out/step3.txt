Step 3: Develop New Features
To: AI Assistant (Claude / Windsurf)

Subject: New Feature Development Plan

Now that you have successfully migrated the application to a Vite + React project structure, your final task is to implement three new features to enhance its analytical capabilities.

Task List:

Implement the Re/Rx Quadrant Chart:

Goal: Allow users to instantly see the current state of their system in the context of the four quadrants defined in the source document.

Implementation:

In the Dashboard.jsx component, use the ScatterChart component from the recharts library.

The chart's X-axis should represent Re log (Potential) and the Y-axis should represent Rx scaled (Outcome).

Plot a single point representing the most recent time point snapshot for the active project.

Use <ReferenceArea> components or background styling to visually divide the chart into the four quadrants: "Thriving System" (top-right), "Latent Potential" (bottom-right), "Unsustainable Performance" (top-left), and "Degenerative System" (bottom-left).

Improve Data Management & Visibility:

Goal: Make it easier for users to review and understand their saved data.

Implementation:

Populate Label on Load: In the App.jsx component, modify the loadTimePoint function. When a user clicks the "Load" button for a saved snapshot, ensure the "Snapshot Label" input field is also populated with the label of that snapshot.

Expandable Snapshot Details: In the Dashboard.jsx component, make each item in the "Saved Time Points" list expandable. When a user clicks to expand an item, it should display a detailed breakdown of the individual scores (L, I, F, E, X, Fg, Î©) that were part of that saved snapshot.

Upon completion of these tasks, the application will be a feature-complete analysis tool.
