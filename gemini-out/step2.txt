Step 2: Migrate the Prototype to a Vite + React Application

Your next task is to take the existing prototype and refactor it into a standard, production-ready Vite + React application. The prototype is a single HTML file (coming-from-gemini.html) where all libraries are loaded from a CDN. This is not a scalable approach, so you will rebuild it properly.

Action Items:

Refactor the Code from the Prototype:

Break down the prototype's code into individual React components (e.g., Dashboard.jsx, Slider.jsx, ProjectManager.jsx) and place them in this new directory.

The main App component should reside in src/App.jsx.

This is critical: Replace all CDN-based library access with modern ES6 import statements at the top of each relevant file.

Example 1: const { useState } = React; becomes import { useState } from 'react';

Example 2: const { LineChart } = window.Recharts; becomes import { LineChart, ... } from 'recharts';

After completing these steps, you should have a fully functional Vite application that runs locally and replicates the prototype's functionality but with a professional project structure. You are now ready for Step 3.
